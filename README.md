# Cross_sectional_area_analysis_Time_series

The MATLAB code imports x-y coordinates of river bank and water level depth as a function of time, sampled every 10 minutes.
The code calculates the cross-sectional area for each water level depth. 
The code writes the following data to excel: date/time, depth of water level, and cross-sectional area for each water-level depth.
